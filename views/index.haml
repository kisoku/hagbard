    Hi! How's it going?
  
  %p
    Perhaps you would like to ask a question ?
  %form{ :action => "/reading", :method => "post" }
    %p
      %textarea{ :name => "question", :rows => "10", :cols => "70"}
      %br
      %input{ :type => "submit", :value => "submit"}
  
  %p
    Or maybe you just want to 
    %a{ :href => "/browse" }
      browse the different hexagrams ?
