    SYNOPSIS
  
  %p
    This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram <a href="/hex/27">27</a>) with an
    obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot
    meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the
    obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for
    lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature.
    Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the
    lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing
    tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances
    of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of
    this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung,
    CONFLICT (<a href="/hex/6">6</a>), which refers to civil suits.

    THE JUDGEMENT
  
  %p.boxed
    BITING THROUGH has success.
    It is favorable to let justice be administered.
  
  %p
    When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success.
    This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the
    obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking
    the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at
    once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord.
    Judgement and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
    However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram
    combines Li, clarity, and Ch&ecirc;n, excitement. Li is yielding, Ch&ecirc;n is hard.
  
  %p
    Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out
    punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two
    together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes
    the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he
    commands respect by his conduct in his position.

    THE IMAGE
  
  %p.boxed
    Thunder and lighting:
    The image of BITING THROUGH.
    Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws
    Through clearly defined penalties.
  
  %p
    Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws
    specify the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe
    penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes.
    This is symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened
    by a just application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror
    of thunder. This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling
    respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.
    The obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a
    lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them.
    The only to strengthen the law is to make it clear and make penalties
    certain and swift.

    THE LINES
  
  %p.boxed
    Nine at the beginning means:
    His feet are fastened in the stocks,
    So that his toes disappear.
    No blame.
  
  %p
    If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong, the
    penalty is a mild one.  Only the toes are put in the stocks.  This prevents him
    from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame.  It is a warning to
    halt in time on the path of evil.
  
  %p.boxed
    Six  in the second place means:
    Bites through tender meat,
    So that his nose disappears.
    No blame.
  
  %p
    It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case;
    it is like biting through tender meat. But one encounters a
    hardened sinner, and, aroused by anger, one goes a little too
    far. The disappearance of the nose in the course of the bite
    signifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility. However,
    there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such is
    just.
  
  %p.boxed
    Six  in the third place means:
    Bites on old dried meat
    And strikes on something poisonous.
    Slight humiliation.  No blame.
  
  %p
    Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and
    authority to do so.  Therefore the culprits do not submit.  The matter at issue
    is an old one-as symbolized by salted game-and in dealing with it difficulties
    arise.  This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the problem the punisher arouses
    poisonous hatred against himself, and n this way is put in a somewhat
    humiliating position.  But since punishment was required by the time, he
    remains free of blame.
  
  %p.boxed
    Nine in the fourth place means:
    Bites on dried gristly meat.
    Receives metal arrows.
    It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties
    And to be persevering.
    Good fortune.
  
  %p
    There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to be
    punished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is necessary to
    be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties. If one
    knows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good fortune.
    The difficult task is achieved in the end.
  
  %p.boxed
    Six in the fifth place means:
    Bites on dried lean meat.
    Receives yellow gold.
    Perseveringly aware of danger.
    No blame.
  
  %p
    The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear.  Since we
    naturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like yellow
    gold-that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the color of the middle
    [the mean]. It is only by remaining conscious of the dangers growing out of
    the responsibility we have assumed that we can avoid making mistakes.
  
  %p.boxed
    Nine at the top means:
    His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,
    So that his ears disappear.
    Misfortune.
  
  %p
    In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who is incorrigible. His
    punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears disappear under it-that is to
    say, he is deaf to warnings. This obstinacy leads to misfortune.
